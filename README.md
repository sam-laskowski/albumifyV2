# Albumify

This project was created in Next.js and uses the public Deezer api in order to get the information about all the albums. It allows a user to create an account and add albums of their choice to one of two sections: a To Listen, and a Rated section. The first of the two allows the user to view all albums which they would like to listen to in the future. It helps create a space for them where they can visually see all the albums they want to listen to. Once they have listened to one, they can then rate the album in accordance with how much they enjoyed it. Rated albums will then be held in the Rated section, where they are displayed in order of rank (highest first).
